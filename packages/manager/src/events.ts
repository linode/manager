/**
 * This file fills two needs;
 *  Maintain the polling interval for events,
 *  Push events from Redux onto the events$ stream.
 *
 * The pushing of events onto events$ is maintaining the existing API between Redux and components
 * which consume the events$ stream. Once all of the consumers of events$ have been updated
 * to consume directly from the Redux store, we can delete the events$ stream.
 *
 * The next step is to move this logic into a Redux connected component so we can more easily
 * access Redux and control the start of the event loop.
