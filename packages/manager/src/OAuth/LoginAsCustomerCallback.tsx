 * This component is similar to the OAuth component, in that it's main
 * purpose is to consume the data given from the hash params provided from
 * where the user was navigated from. In the case of this component, the user
 * was navigated from Admin and the query params differ from what they would be
 * if the user navigated from Login. Further, we are doing no nonce checking here.
 *
 * Admin will redirect to Cloud Manager with a URL like:
 * https://cloud.linode.com/admin/callback#access_token=fjhwehkfg&destination=dashboard&expires_in=900&token_type=Admin
