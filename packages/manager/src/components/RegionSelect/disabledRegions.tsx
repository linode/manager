/* THIS FILE and the CONCEPT OF FAKE REGIONS IS GOING AWAY WITH DC GET WELL
/* Not reorganizing utils and types for this file for this reason.
/*
/* Those fake regions are a way to display a region that is not available for selection, and removed from the API response.
/* They are a visual indicator that the region is not available, and a link to learn more about why, as to not confuse the user when they don't see the region in the list.
/* The whole concept is going away with DC Get Well (which is great news cause this isn't a sustainable feature), since the API will provide a new endpoint to evaluate the DC's availability.
