# Welcome

_The mission of **Linode** is to accelerate innovation by making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all._

- Linode Storybook is a resource for the UI, behavior, code, and guidelines for use of all components in the Cloud Manager.
- It is the single source truth for approved components and a living document that will incorporate new components and refinements for existing components.

## Contributing to the Design System

### Process for adding or editing components

Simply because a new UI element is created and used in Cloud Manager does not mean itâ€™s automatically included in the Design System. For a new component to be added, it should provide a significant benefit over existing components and be useful for future applications.
