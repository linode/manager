# Color Palette

Add a new color to the palette, especially another tint of gray or blue, only after exhausting the option of using an existing color.

- Colors used in light mode are located in `themeFactory.ts`
- Colors used in dark mode are located in `themes.ts`

If a color does not exist in the current palette and is only used once, consider applying the color conditionally:

`theme.name === 'lightTheme' ? '#fff' : '#000'`
