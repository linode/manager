# Radio

### Use radio buttons to

- Expose all available options
- Select a single option from a list

### Guidelines

- If there are 3 or fewer items to select, use radio buttons rather than drop-down menus.
- If possible, offer a default selection.
- Because radio buttons allow only one choice, make sure that the options are both comprehensive and distinct.
- Let users select an option by clicking on either the button itself or its label to provide as big a target area as possible.

### Reasons for a Default Selection

- Expedite tasks
- Give people control and align with their expectations
