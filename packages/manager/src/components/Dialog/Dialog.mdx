# Dialogs

## Overview
A modal dialog is a window that appears on top of a parent screen. It's called 'modal' because it creates a mode that disables the parent screen but keeps it visible. Users must interact with the modal to return to the main screen.

> ⚠️ In Cloud Manager, dialogs will lock focus onto the dialog and prevent scrolling. For the sake of previewing dialogs, this does not occur in Storybook.

### Modal Types
- **Standard**
  - Has an "X" button in the top right
  - Can contain anything in the body of the dialog
- **Confirmation**
  - Users must confirm a choice
- **Deletion**
  - The user must confirm the deleteion of an entity
  - Can require user to type the entity name to confirm deletion


> Clicking off of the modal will not close it.
> A modal can only be closed by taking direct action, clicking on a button or the “X” button, or using the `esc` key.

### Confirmation Dialog

---

A Confirmation Dialog is used for confirming a simple task.

> If you are confirming a delete action, use a `Deletion Dialog`

### Language
- Avoid “Are you sure?” language. Assume the user knows what they want to do while helping them avoid unintended consequences.

### Deletion Dialog

---

A Deletion Dialog is used for deleting entities such as Linodes, NodeBalancers, Volumes, or other entities.

Require `typeToConfirm` when an action would have a significant negative impact if done in error, consider requiring the user to enter a unique identifier such as entity label before activating the action button.
If a user has opted out of type-to-confirm this will be ignored
