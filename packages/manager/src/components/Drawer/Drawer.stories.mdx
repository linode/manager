# Drawer

#### Overview

- Drawers are essentially modal dialogs that appear on the right of the screen rather than the center.
- Like traditional modals, they block interaction with the page content.
- They are elevated above the app’s UI and don’t affect the screen’s layout grid.

#### Behavior

- Clicking a button on the screen opens the drawer.
- Clicking off of the drawer closes it and data will not be saved.
- Drawers can also be closed by clicking the “X” icon or the “Close” button.

export const Template = (args, context) => {
  const close = () => context.setOpen(false);
  return (
    <>
      <Button buttonType="primary" onClick={() => context.setOpen(true)}>
        Click to open Drawer
      </Button>
      <Drawer title="My Drawer" {...args} open={context.open} onClose={close}>
        <Typography>
          This is some test copy which acts as content for this Drawer
          component. It's very interesting and you should read all of it. This
          text has to be sufficiently long to test that it doesn't expand the
          drawer to an unreasonable width.
        </Typography>
        <TextField
          label="Input Some Text"
          placeholder="This is a placeholder"
        />
        <ActionsPanel>
          <Button buttonType="primary" onClick={close}>
            Save
          </Button>
          <Button buttonType="secondary" onClick={close}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
        </ActionsPanel>
      </Drawer>
    </>
  );
