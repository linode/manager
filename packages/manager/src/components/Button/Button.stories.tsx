/**
 * Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.
 * - Buttons are aligned right with primary button to the far right and secondary buttons positioned to the left.
 * - There can be more than one secondary button.
 * - Ideally there is one primary button per page. This helps provide a visual focus to the main purpose of the page.
 * - Button labels should support the user taking their desired action by clearly stating what will happen when clicked (ex. Create Linode, Delete Firewall).
 * - There is no destructive button style. We do not take an implied position on the userâ€™s knowledge or intention by using an alert color such as red for destructive actions.
