# Dismissible Banners

### Usage

Banners appear between the top nav and page content and are a visual interruption of the normal page layout. Their use must be approved by all project stakeholders.

### Design

- Banners are dismissible using an &rsquo;X&rsquo; icon.
- Consider adding a link to a doc or a guide for users to learn more.
- Banners should be considered as one part of a larger communications plan; messaging should be developed with the marketing team.

### Variants

- Marketing: Informs users of a new feature or improved service.
- Warning: Informs users of an impending change that will have an impact on their service(s).
- Call to action: Primary Button or text link allows a user to take action directly from the banner.

export const DismissibleBannerTemplate = (args) => {
  const { productInformationIndicator } = args;
  return (
    <DismissibleBanner
      productInformationIndicator={productInformationIndicator}
    >
      <Typography>This is an example of a dismissible banner.</Typography>
    </DismissibleBanner>
  );
};

export const StatusBannersTemplate = (args) => {
  const { message, title, status, impact, href } = args;
  return <StatusBanners {...args} />;
};

        description:
          'Indicates whether the banner communicates information about a product, typically a new feature or improved service. If true, the left border is set to green.',
      },
