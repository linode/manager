# Dismissible Banners

### Usage

Banners appear between the top nav and page content and are a visual interruption of the normal page layout. Their use must be approved by all project stakeholders.

### Design

- Banners are dismissible using an &rsquo;X&rsquo; icon.
- Consider adding a link to a doc or a guide for users to learn more.
- Banners should be considered as one part of a larger communications plan; messaging should be developed with the marketing team.

### Variants

- Beta: Informs users of a feature in beta and includes the [Early Adopter SLA](https://www.linode.com/legal-eatp/).
- Marketing: Informs users of a new feature or improved service.
- Warning: Informs users of an impending change that will have an impact on their service(s).
- Call to action: Primary Button or text link allows a user to take action directly from the banner.
