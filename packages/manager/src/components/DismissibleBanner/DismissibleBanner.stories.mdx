# Dismissible Banners
### Usage
Banners appear between the top nav and page content and are a visual interruption of the normal page layout. Their use must be approved by all project stakeholders.

### Design
- Banners are dismissible using an ‘X’ icon.
- Consider adding a link to a doc or a guide for users to learn more.
- Banners should be considered as one part of a larger communications plan, messaging should be developed with the marketing team.

### Variants
- Marketing: Informs users of a new feature or improved service. 
- Warning: Informs users of an impending change that will have an impact on their service(s).
- Call to action: Primary Button or text link allows a user to take action directly from the banner.
