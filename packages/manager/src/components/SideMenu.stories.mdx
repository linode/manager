# Side Menu

### Overview

<hr />

- The side menu currently has 13 items in three groups.
  - The plan is to eventually remove **Account** and **Help & Support** from the side menu since they are also available in the top menu.
- The Linodes landing page is considered the homepage unless the account is managed. Otherwise, clicking on the Linode logo will take the user to the Managed landing page.

### Adding Items

<hr />

- 15 items is likely the maximum that should be displayed by default since more than that becomes difficult to scan.
- If the number of items in the side menu grows beyond 15, a second tier of items could be made available on hover. Careful consideration should be given to refactoring the information architecture and UI so that customers can easily accomplish their tasks.
