/**
 * Simple wrapper around our Regions query. Originally this was a Redux connect
 * function; it is being retained in this way because there are still a few places
 * where regions data is needed in class components, some of which are difficult
 * or problematic to refactor.
 *
 * This file can be deleted once the existing class components have been removed or converted
 * to FCs (current list is: SelectPlanPanel/SelectPlanQuantityPanel; NodeBalancerCreate; LinodeSelect;
 * LinodeCreate/LinodeCreateContainer). Please do NOT use this wrapper for any future components; if a class
 * component is needed, best practice is to include an FC container above it (the routing level often works well)
 * and pass regions through there.
