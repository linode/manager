This is the new Linode Manager. It provides a web interface for managing your

Linode account. Currently this software is *early-access* and is available at [cloud.linode.com](https://cloud.linode.com).

Come chat with us in [#linode-next on

interested in helping out with this. We'd love to have community input on how
the new manager takes shape. This is your chance to help build the features you
need into it! We'll take pull requests in the usual way. We're still learning
about the technologies in use here ourselves, so bear with us as we figure out
the right patterns - some large scale refactorings may be in order.
