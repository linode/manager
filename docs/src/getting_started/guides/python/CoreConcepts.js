        <h2>Filtering</h2>
        <p>
          All listing methods of the LinodeClient object can be "filtered," allowing you to query for only the objects you desire. Filtering uses a SQLAlchemy-inspired syntax. All attributes that are filterable are marked with a Filterable <i className="fa fa-filter"></i> icon below.
        </p>
        <Table
          columns={[
            { headerClassName: 'OperatorColumn', dataKey: 'operator', label: 'Operator' },
            { dataKey: 'description', label: 'Description' }
          ]}
          data={[
            { operator: '==', description: 'Fields must be exactly equal' },
            { operator: 'contains', description: 'Equivalent to "b in a"' },
            { operator: '>', description: 'Equivalent to "b in a"' },
            { operator: '>=', description: 'Greater than or equal to (numeric)' },
            { operator: '<', description: 'Less than (numeric)' },
            { operator: '<=', description: 'Less than or equal to (numeric)' },
          ]}
        />
        <p>
          Logical operators are provided to combine filters. They are listed below:
        </p>
        <Table
          columns={[
            { headerClassName: 'OperatorColumn', dataKey: 'operator', label: 'Operator' },
            { headerClassName: 'OperatorColumn', dataKey: 'shorthand', label: '' },
            { dataKey: 'description', label: 'Description' }
          ]}
          data={[
            { operator: 'linode.and_', shorthand: '&', description: 'Both filters must match for the composite filter to match.  The single character method requires the filter statements to both be in parenthesis.' },
            { operator: 'linode.or_', shorthand: '|', description: 'Either filter must match for the composite filter to match. The single character method requires the filters statements to both be in parenthesis.' },
          ]}
        />

        <h2>Volatile Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Many API Objects have attributes labeled Volatile <i className="fa fa-flash"></i>. Volatile attributes are refreshed when requested if they were last updated before a certain time (at time of writing, this interval is 15 seconds). This allows you to get a current value for potentially-changing attributes when required, without having to write extra calls into your code. All volatile attributes are labeled in the object reference below as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it <em>is</em> possible to poll on volatile attributes to detect changes, doing so without a timeout is not advised, and is not guaranteed to ever exit. For example, this code should <em>not</em> live in a production system:
        </p>
        <Example
          example={`linode.boot()
while not linode.state == 'running':
    pass`}
          name="python"
        />
        <p>
          This code may work most of the time, but it is not guaranteed that <code>linode.state</code> will ever be seen as running just because you called <code>boot</code>. For instance, another process could delete the linode and our poll may not hit during any window where the state is "running".
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Updating and Deleting Objects</h2>
        <p>
          All API resources are represented as objects, and all objects you own can be updated and deleted (an object you own would be a Linode or a DNS Zone, as opposed to a Datacenter or Service, which are accessible to you but cannot be modified or removed).
        </p>
        <p>
          Any attribute of any object that you can update will be marked Editable <i className="fa fa-pencil"></i>in the object reference below. These attributes can be assigned as normal, and updated in the server with a call to <code>save()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any object you own can be removed from your account with a call to <code>delete()</code>. This is non-reversible, so be careful calling this function.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Pagination</h2>
        <p>
          While many API requests are paginated, all listing calls in the Python Library return <code>PaginatedLists</code> that handle loading additional pages seamlessly. While these lists are not intended to be long-lived (i.e. do not store a PaginatedList that you expect to change, as it will not update itself), it does allow easy iteration over all resources without having to worry about when a page transition occurs.
