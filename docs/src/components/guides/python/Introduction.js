          With the release of API V4, Linode has also released an official Python library.  This guide is a simple introduction to working with
          the Python library.
          The official Linode Python library is open source on <a href="http://github.com/Linode/python-linode-api">Github</a>, and can be installed:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>pip install linode-api</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In order to make requests to the API, you're going to need an OAuth Token.  You can make a personal access token at <a href="https://cloud.linode.com/profile/integrations/tokens" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cloud.linode.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Connecting to the API</h2>
        <p>
          The Python library connects to the Linode API V4 using the LinodeClient class, which expects an OAuth Token in his constructor.
        </p>
        <i>All example code in this guide is executed in a Python shell.</i>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> import linode
>>> client = linode.LinodeClient('my-oauth-token')`}
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

        <h2>Requirements for Creating a Linode</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create a Linode, we need a Regions (which defines where it will live) and a Service (which defines the size of the Linode). Since we don’t know the IDs of any objects in the API, we’ll list them to see what we want:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> for r in client.get_regions():
...   print(r.label)
...
Dallas, TX
Fremont, CA
Atlanta, GA
Newark, NJ
London, UK
Singapore, SG
Frankfurt, DE
Tokyo 2, JP
Tokyo, JP`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We've got a lot of regions to pick from - let's just use the first one and move on.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          >>> region = client.get_regions()[0]
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          For a Service, we know that we want "Linode 2048". Since we know the service type’s label, we don’t need to list all services, we can just use the label:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> serv = linode.Service(client, 'g5-standard-1')
>>> serv.label
'Linode 2048'`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here we are creating the service object by label - the label is used where IDs are used for other objects. While creating objects this way can be useful, we can also use the label in place of the service object in all places it would be used.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Making a Linode</h2>
        <p>
          Since we have everything we need to make a Linode, we can create one with the LinodeClient:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          >>> l = client.linode.create_instance(serv, region)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          And that’s it! Now we’ve got a fresh new Linode. Let’s check it out:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> l.label
'linode263'
>>> l.ipv4
['97.107.143.33']
>>> l.state
'offline'`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          That’s great, but this Linode is empty, and booting it wouldn’t make sense, since we created it without disks or a distribution. Let’s make another Linode, this time with Debian on it, and boot it so we can ssh in.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Getting a Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          We already know how to retrieve objects from the API, but this time we want something more vague - a Debian template. Which version? What are our options? Let’s have a look at all of the recommended Debian templates:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> for d in client.linode.get_distributions(linode.Distribution.vendor == 'Debian', linode.Distribution.recommended == True):
...   print("{}: {}".format(d.label, d.id))
...
Debian 7: linode/debian7
Debian 8.8: linode/debian8`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The Python library uses SQLAlchemy-like filtering syntax - any field marked filterable can be searched by in this manner. We can chain filters together to run more complex searches, and even use SQLAlchemy operators like and_ and or_ if needed. This search reveals some options. Since Debian 8 is the newest Debian template available, let’s use it.

          Since we have the id for the distribution, we don’t need to construct an object.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Creating a Linode (with a Distribution)</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we have a distribution, let’s make a new Linode running it! But first, let’s clean up that first Linode that we don’t really need:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> l.delete()
True`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now that that’s gone, we can create a new Linode running Debian 8:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            >>> l, pw = client.linode.create_instance(serv, region, distribution="linode/debian8")
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This time, we called <code>create_instance</code> with a "distribution" keyword argument. This tells the API what we want on the new Linode, and it will do "the right thing" to give you a working configuration. Since a Distribution needs a root password and we didn’t provide one, the client helpfully generated one for us and returned it as well. Let’s boot it and wait for it to come online:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> l.boot()
True
>>> while not l.state == 'running':
    ...   pass
  ...
  >>> l.ipv4
['97.107.143.34']
>>> pw
'663Iso_f1y4Zb5xeClY13fBGdeu5l&f3'`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code>boot()</code> does just what you’d expect. Once we’ve requested a boot, we wait for the Linode’s state to be "running". Since state is a "volatile" attribute of a Linode, we can poll it. At fixed intervals, the value will be updated via a background API request. Once that loop exists, we can ssh in.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`>>> exit()
$ ssh root@97.107.143.34
