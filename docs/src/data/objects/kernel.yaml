description: >
  Kernel objects describe a Linux kernel that can be booted on a Linode. Some
  special kernels are available that have special behavior, such as "Direct
  Disk", which will boot your disk directly instead of supplying a kernel
  directly to the hypervisor. The latest kernels are
  "linode/latest_64" (64 bit) and "linode/latest" (32bit).
